## Overview
The microprocessor project simulates the operation of a simple microprocessor. It allows users to write and execute assembly code, showcasing the basic concepts of computer architecture, such as instruction sets, memory, and registers. This project is intended for educational purposes and provides a hands-on experience in working with low-level programming and hardware abstraction.

## Features
- **Assembly Language Simulation**: Execute basic assembly instructions.
- **Memory and Register Handling**: Simulate memory management and register operations.
- **Basic I/O Operations**: Perform input/output operations using the simulated microprocessor.
- **Instruction Set**: Support for fundamental instructions like load, store, add, and jump.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository and follow the installation instructions provided below.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (or any other language used for simulation)
- Basic understanding of assembly language and microprocessor architecture

```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rdabbaghi/University---Microprocessor.git
    cd University---Microprocessor
    ```

2. Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Once the project is installed, you can start the microprocessor simulation by running the main script. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

2. Run the simulation with a sample assembly program:
    ```bash
    python microprocessor.py ../examples/sample_program.asm
    ```

Make sure to write your own assembly code or modify the existing examples to see how different instructions are handled.
