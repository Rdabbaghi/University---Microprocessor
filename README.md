## Overview

The Arduino Microprocessor project focuses on implementing basic input/output (I/O) operations, sensor reading, and controlling peripherals such as LEDs, motors, and displays using an **Arduino** board. This project aims to provide a fundamental understanding of microcontroller programming and hardware interaction.

### Key Objectives:
- **Microcontroller Simulation**: Control devices and perform tasks using the Arduino platform.
- **Sensor Data Processing**: Read and process data from sensors.
- **Actuator Control**: Control actuators like motors and LEDs based on input conditions.
- **Modular Code Design**: Write reusable and maintainable code.

## Features

- **Support for Multiple Sensors**: Includes examples for reading data from temperature sensors, light sensors, and other common devices.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Allows for real-time monitoring and data handling.
- **Basic Actuator Control**: Examples include controlling LEDs, servos, and motors based on input data.
- **Serial Communication**: Provides methods for communicating with a computer or other devices through the serial interface.

## Hardware Requirements

To successfully run this project, you will need the following components:

- **Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, or Nano)**
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**
- **Sensors (e.g., temperature sensor, photoresistor)**
- **Actuators (e.g., LEDs, motors, or a display)**
- **Power Supply (e.g., USB cable for Arduino)**

### Example Setup:

Hereâ€™s a basic setup for controlling an LED with an Arduino board:
- **LED**: Connected to digital pin 13.
- **Sensor**: A temperature sensor connected to analog pin A0.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rdabbaghi/University---Microprocessor.git
    cd University---Microprocessor
    ```

2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the example sketches located in the `examples/` directory. To open a sketch, go to **File > Open** and select the `.ino` file you want to use.

## Usage

Once the project is loaded in the Arduino IDE, follow these steps to upload and run the code:

1. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the desired `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Select the appropriate board from **Tools > Board > Arduino Uno (or your specific board)**.
4. Choose the correct serial port from **Tools > Port**.
5. Click **Upload** to upload the code to your Arduino board.
6. Once uploaded, the Arduino will start executing the code, and you can monitor its behavior using the serial monitor.

### Example Sketch:

Hereâ€™s an example sketch for reading a temperature sensor and controlling an LED:

```cpp
int ledPin = 13;
int sensorPin = A0;
float temperature;

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  temperature = analogRead(sensorPin) * (5.0 / 1023.0 * 100);
  Serial.println(temperature);

  if (temperature > 30.0) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }

  delay(1000);
}
```

This sketch reads temperature data from a sensor and turns on an LED if the temperature exceeds 30Â°C.
